## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal make it very clear what you're going to aim for while developing your personal site. I especially like how you explain your primary goal and that it is not only to obtain employment (like most pwps) but also to showcase your creative side.

Your Persona links back to your purpose very well. Throughout the class, you'll learn the best ways to link your social media to your website in very aesthetically pleasing ways. If your goal is to get featured on some sort of website or magazine for your creative designs, I'm excited to see what you will do during development. Keep thinking of ideas! 

Your Use Case is also very well written. Overall, you did a great job on this part of the milestone. Great job!

Directory structure is perfect

Your HTML is also perfect. You went all out with the css and classes and have no issues. Fantastic Job.

### You've passed Milestone 1 in Tier IV - keep up the good work on the next milestones.


## Milestone 2a Feedback
Your HTML is very well written. Good job here. Your directory structure needs some work, and I'll go into that in the "edits" section below.

I like your content strategy. How are you going to implement your theme of "movement?" Your three sections should be divided well, and I have no doubt you will make it entertaining for the user.

Your video montage on the home page should be easy to implement, although I'm not sure a rotating gallery of videos would be the best for this. Here is a jsfiddle I found about creating a jumbotron with a video: https://jsfiddle.net/kae4q601/5/

You may want to rething this. I like the idea of a video on the home page as long as there is no sound, but I would suggest choosing either one video to play here, or switching to a single image that shows on the home page. Further down in the site, you could include a full gallery. This is all up to you, of course.

I love the idea of your About section. Very nice quote, and the addition of a technical toolbox is a great thing to include on your site. I would suggest using the logos for the different languages that you are proficient in within this section. Think about interesting ways to do this.

For your Portfolio section, you may want to consider using an image slider to feature pictures. The Bootstrap framework does have an image slider included, but it's not that great. If this is a feature you're interested in having on the site, take a look at the Flickity Slider, the Owl Carosel or Slick. These are only a few of many available slider options out there, and these are mobile/touch friendly. For the Social Media icons, have a look Font Awesome. Very easy to use, simple and straightforward. http://fontawesome.io/


## Edits
stylesheet needs to go into a seperate directory.
#### For example, instead of 
public_html -> documentation -> style.css, milestones
#### It should be 
public_html -> documentation, styles
and your stylesheet should be WITHIN the styles directory. Hopefully my sloppy directory structure explanation makes sense there.

Also, the images directory needs to be within public_html


### Overall, fantastic job. Just a couple things you need to watch out for. Your wireframes are very nice, and I'm excited to see what you actually do with the site. You've passed Milestone 2a in Tier III. Great work.
