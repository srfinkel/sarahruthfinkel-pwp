## Milestone 1 Feedback
Your Purpose, Audience, and Goal make it very clear what you're going to aim for while developing your personal site. I especially like how you explain your primary goal and that it is not only to obtain employment (like most pwps) but also to showcase your creative side.

Your Persona links back to your purpose very well. Throughout the class, you'll learn the best ways to link your social media to your website in very aesthetically pleasing ways. If your goal is to get featured on some sort of website or magazine for your creative designs, I'm excited to see what you will do during development. Keep thinking of ideas! 

Your Use Case is also very well written. Overall, you did a great job on this part of the milestone. Great job!

Directory structure is perfect

Your HTML is also perfect. You went all out with the css and classes and have no issues. Fantastic Job.

### You've passed Milestone 1 in Tier IV - keep up the good work on the next milestones.
